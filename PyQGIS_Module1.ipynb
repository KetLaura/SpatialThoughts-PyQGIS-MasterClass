    "What is a Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can be thought of as a template, which contains certain functions and properties. It cannot be used on its own. It can be thought as a blueprint, were you can see the object but it must be made first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a class in a program, you must construct an object from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out which variable is a class and which one is an object, a good way is to use [print] function and the type gets printed to console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance is an object of a class.\n",
    "You can create an instance of a class by calling the constructor.\n",
    "The constructor in Python is a function named _init_()/\n",
    "_init() takes at least one parameter called self\n",
    "    self refers to the current instance that is being constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the self function, an object must first be created before running the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if class is Car:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an object my_car = Car(\"blue\", \"automatic\") using parameters attachted to a Car class\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can use the function for example my_car.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions inside of a class are called methods.\n",
    "Variables inside a class are called attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "-They are associated with a particular object\n",
    "-Every object can have a different value\n",

    "Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be derived from another class.\n",
    "The derived class \"inherits\" all fearures of the base class\n",
